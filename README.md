Postprocessing of the results of SXRD experiment at DLS (B16 - MM28395)

This repository contains all scripts which were developed to postprocess experimental results obtained during MM28395 experiment conducted at the Diamond Light Source (September/October 2021). 

The target of the experiment was to measure lattice strains in thin-walled, channel section profiles subjected to buckling.
